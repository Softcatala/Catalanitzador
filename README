Before building the libraries, go to all the projects within the gmock solution a do the following steps: 

- Go to the project properties -> Configuration Properties -> C++ Code Generation
- Select "Multithreaded Debug Dll". 

For gtest, this should be the default configuration, if it is not, do also the same steps.

For gtest, build using the gtest-md.sln solution.
