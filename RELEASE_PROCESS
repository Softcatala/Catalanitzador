** Checklist

- Download the CatalanitzadorPerAlWindows.exe from its final location and executed

In the CatalanitzadorPerAlWindows.log you should see this line:

'ConfigurationDownloadThread::OnStart. Remote file same version that the embedded'

Indicating the file embed and the remote configuration.xml are identical.

- Execute the previous version and check that is auto-updated

** Changing configuration.xml **

- Update the <date> field with the modification date of the changes that you are introducing.
Catalanitzador will only use the remote file if its date is newer than the version of the file embed in 
the application.

Run DownloadFilesChecker to help you verify that the changes are correct

- The <version> tag in the compatibility tag section indicates the minimum version of Catalanitzador
needed to support the XML. If you have made changes that break the XML and there are only clients
using this URL increase the version to number to the most recent version to prevent old clients from
using the file.
