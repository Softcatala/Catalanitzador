This document documnent describes the Catalanitzador coding standards

--- Naming

* For Classes, interfaces, enums and structures use UpperCamelCase 

For example:

class SystemRestore

* For variables and variales we use LowerCamelCase 

For example:

int systemRestore

Prefixes:

- 'm_' to indicate member variable such as 'm_processes'
- 'g_' to indicate that is a global variable 'g_currentObject'

* For methods, if they are public we use UpperCamelCase and if they are private
or protected the prefix with '_' with LowerCamelCase

For example:

public:
		void FinishExecution(ExecutionProcess process);

protected:
		void _enumVersions(vector <wstring>& versions);



* For constants, we use UPPER case, for example:

#define APPLICATON_WEBSITE	L"http://catalanitzador.softcatala.org"
